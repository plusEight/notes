##CS 61 Review

###Bytes & Powers of 2
2^16 = 64 Kbyte
2^10 is k, 2^6 = 64
"KB" Kilobyte vs "Kb" Kilobit

###Microprocessors vs Designing Digital Circuits
Microprocessors are much easier to work with, and much cheaper to make
However
* Power hungry
* May be too slow

Ex. Wing controller on an airplane, must execute and update 100x a second
* custom circuit required

Can combine the two, such as with a digital camera
* For a scenario with Read, Compress, Store
  * Digital Circuit for Read
	* Digital Circuit for Write
	* Microprocessor for compressing
