##Intro

Combinational Circuit
* Outputs depend soley on the present combination of circuit imputs
Sequential Circuit
* Has memory that impacts outputs too

###Switches
Switches are the basis of binary circuits
* 3 parts (transistor)
	* Source input
	* Source Output
	* Control input

###CMOS Transistor
* nMOS
* pMOS

###Moore's Law
Dude noticed that every 18 months or so, transistors shrink to about 1/2 the
size. So far still true.

###Boolean Algebra
Dude named George Boole tried to formalize human thought
F(a,b,c) = a'bc+abc'+ab+c
* Variables
  * shown by F(a,b,c)
* Literal
	* a, a', b, b', c, c'
